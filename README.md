# Train_Dispatcher

A train dispatcher's primary job is to ensure that trains are properly routed for their respective destinations. He or she must choose routings that are safe and that allow the train to reach its destination in a prompt manner to satisfy tight schedules.

This project attempts to simulate what a railroad dispatcher may see on a Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) display panel. A GUI will be used to show tracks, interlockings, signals, and track occupancy. The user will be allowed to change routings and signal indications to allow trains to proceed to the correct destination without any collisions.

A toolkit such as Tkinter will be used to create the interface.
