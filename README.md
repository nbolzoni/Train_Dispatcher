# Train_Dispatcher

A train dispatcher's primary job is to ensure that trains are properly routed for their respective destinations. He or she must choose routings that are safe and that allow the train to reach its destination in a prompt manner to satisfy tight schedules.

This project attempts to simulate what a railroad dispatcher may see on a Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) display panel.
